# blogWithAdmin
This is a blog built with NodeJs And MongoDB
It has a login panel for normal users.
Each user can post with images.
It also has an admin panel that has a seperate login system
The site is ok but with just some more frontend pages and edits to the admin panel then you are ready to deploy
